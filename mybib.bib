	abstract  ="The molecular understanding of charge-transport in organic crystals has often been tangled with identifying the true dynamical origin. While in two distinct cases where complete delocalization and localization of charge-carriers are associated with band-like and hopping-like transports{,} respectively{,} their possible coalescence poses some mystery. Moreover{,} the existing models are still controversial at ambient temperatures. Here{,} we review the issues in charge-transport theories of organic materials and then provide an overview of prominent transport models. We explored ∼60 organic crystals{,} the single-crystal hole/electron mobilities of which have been predicted by band-like and hopping-like transport models{,} separately. Our comparative results show that at room-temperature neither of the models are exclusively capable of accurately predicting mobilities in a very broad range. Hopping-like models well-predict experimental mobilities around μ ∼ 1 cm2 V−1 s−1 but systematically diverge at high mobilities. Similarly{,} band-like models are good at μ > ∼50 cm2 V−1 s−1 but systematically diverge at lower mobilities. These results suggest the development of a unique and robust room-temperature transport model incorporating a mixture of these two extreme cases{,} whose relative importance is associated with their predominant regions. We deduce that while band models are beneficial for rationally designing high mobility organic-semiconductors{,} hopping models are good to elucidate the charge-transport of most organic-semiconductors."

Reference data are obtained with spin-component scaled approximate coupled cluster method (SCS-CC2) and large basis sets. Assessed DFT-based approaches include constrained density functional theory (CDFT){,} fragment-orbital DFT (FODFT){,} self-consistent charge density functional tight-binding (FODFTB) and the recently described analytic overlap method (AOM). This complements the previously reported HAB11 database where only cationic dimers were considered. The CDFT method in combination with a functional based on PBE and including 50% of exact exchange (HFX) was found to provide best estimates{,} with a mean relative unsigned error (MRUE) of 8.2%. CDFT couplings systematically increase with decreasing fraction of HFX as a consequence of increasing delocalisation of the SOMO orbital. The FODFT method is found to be very robust underestimating electronic couplings by 28%. The FODFTB and AOM methods{,} although orders of magnitude more efficient in terms of computational effort than the DFT approaches{,} perform well with reasonably small errors of 54% and 29%{,} respectively{,} translating in errors in the non-adiabatic electron transfer rate of a factor of 2.4 and 1.7{,} respectively. We discuss carefully various sources of errors and the scope and limitations of all assessed methods taking into account the results obtained for both HAB7- and HAB11 databases."

	abstract  ="Investigation of many electronic processes in molecules and materials{,} such as charge and exciton transport{,} requires a computational framework that incorporates both non-adiabatic electronic effects and nuclear quantum effects{,} in particular at low temperatures. We have recently developed an efficient semi-empirical fewest switches surface hopping method{,} denoted fragment orbital-based surface hopping (FOB-SH){,} that was tailored towards highly efficient simulation of charge transport in molecular materials{,} yet with nuclei treated classically. In this work{,} we extend FOB-SH and include nuclear quantum effects by combining it with ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) in three different flavours: (i) RPSH with bead approximation (RPSH-BA) as suggested in Shushkov et al.{,} J. Chem. Phys.{,} 2012{,} 137{,} 22A549{,} (ii) a modification of (i) denoted RPSH with weighted bead approximation (RPSH-wBA) and (iii) the isomorphic Hamiltonian method of Tao et al.{,} J. Chem. Phys.{,} 2018{,} 148{,} 10237 (SH-RP-iso). We present here applications to hole transfer in a molecular dimer model and analyze detailed balance and internal consistency of all three methods and investigate the temperature and driving force dependence of the hole transfer rate. We find that RPSH-BA strongly underestimates and RPSH-wBA overestimates the exact excited state population{,} while SH-RP-iso gives satisfactory results. We also find that the latter predicts a flattening of the rate vs. driving force dependence in the Marcus inverted regime at low temperature{,} as often observed experimentally. Overall{,} our results suggest that FOB-SH combined with SH-RP-iso is a promising method for including zero point motion and tunneling in charge transport simulations in molecular materials and biological systems."

We have recently shown that surface hopping non-adiabatic molecular dynamics is a powerful method for prediction of charge transport mechanisms in organic materials and for near-quantitative prediction of charge mobilities at room temperature where the effects of nuclear zero-point motion and tunneling are still relatively small [S. Giannini et al.{,} Nat. Commun.{,} 2019{,} 10{,} 3843]. Here we assess and critically discuss the extensions to Tully{'}s original method that have led to this success: (i) correction for missing electronic decoherence{,} (ii) detection of trivial crossings and (iii) removal of decoherence correction-induced spurious charge transfer. If any one of these corrections is not included{,} the charge mobility diverges with system size{,} each for different physical reasons. Yet if they are included{,} convergence with system size{,} detailed balance and good internal consistency are achieved."

	abstract  ="The search for conductive soft matter materials with significant charge mobility under ambient conditions has been a major priority in organic electronics (OE) research. Alkylated tetracenes are promising cost-effective candidate molecules that can be synthesized using wet chemistry methods{,} resulting in columnar single crystals with pronounced structural stability at and above room temperature. A remarkable characteristic of these materials is the capability of tuning the tetracene core intracolumnar stacking pattern and the crystal melting point via the side chain length and type modifications. In this study{,} we examine the performance of a series of alkylated tetracenes as hole conducting materials using a novel atomistic simulation technique that allows us to predict both the charge transport mechanism and mobilities. Our simulations demonstrate that molecular wires of alkylated tetracenes are capable of polaronic hole conduction at room temperature{,} with mobility values ranging up to 21 cm2 V−1 s−1{,} thus rendering such materials a highly promising choice for flexible OE applications. As regards the charge transfer robustness{,} two promising tetracene derivatives are identified with the capability of seamless inter-wire polaron delocalization{,} alleviating possible transfer bottlenecks due to local molecular defects. Our findings suggest that alkylated tetracenes offer an attractive route towards flexible columnar OE materials with unprecedented hole mobilities."

To address this problem, a novel fully atomistic non-adiabatic molecular dynamics approach termed fragment orbital-based surface hopping (FOB-SH) that propagates the electron-nuclear motion has been further improved and, for the first time, used to calculate the full 2D charge mobility tensor for the conductive planes of six structurally well characterized organic single crystals, in good agreement with available experimental data. The nature of the charge carrier in these materials is best described as a flickering polaron constantly changing shape and extensions under the influence of thermal disorder. Thermal intra-band excitations from modestly delocalized band edge states (up to 5 nm or 10–20 molecules) to highly delocalized tail states (up to 10 nm or 40–60 molecules in the most conductive materials) give rise to short, ≈ 10 fs-long bursts of the charge carrier wavefunction that drives the spatial displacement of the polaron, resulting in carrier diffusion and mobility. This study implies that key to the design of high-mobility materials is a high density of strongly delocalized and thermally accessible tail states.},

Computer simulations are carried out for a wide range of reorganisation energy (λ){,} electronic coupling strength (Hab) and driving force using our recently developed fragment orbital-based SH approach augmented with a simple decoherence correction. This methodology allows us to compute SH ET rates over more than four orders of magnitude{,} from the sub-picosecond to the nanosecond time regime. We find good agreement with semi-classical ET theory in the non-adiabatic ET regime. The correct scaling of the SH ET rate with electronic coupling strength is obtained and the Marcus inverted regime is reproduced{,} in line with previously reported results for a spin-boson model. Yet{,} we find that the SH ET rate falls below the semi-classical ET rate in the adiabatic regime{,} where the free energy barrier is in the order of kBT in our simulations. We explain this by first signatures of non-exponential population decay of the initial charge state. For even larger electronic couplings (Hab = λ/2){,} the free energy barrier vanishes and ET rates are no longer defined. At this point we observe a crossover from ET on the vibronic time scale to charge relaxation on the femtosecond time scale that is well described by thermally averaged Rabi oscillations. The extension of the analysis from the non-adiabatic limit to large electronic couplings and small or even vanishing activation barriers is relevant for our understanding of charge transport in organic semiconductors."

While single molecular electronic properties can be tailored by synthetic means and their electronic properties can be reliably predicted by quantum chemical calculations{,} crystal structure predictions of such van der Waals bond solids remain challenging. Here we analyze correlations between the molecular structure and the resulting packing motifs adopted in the crystalline phases of the prototypical OSC pentacene as well as various differently substituted but similarly shaped π-conjugated molecules. Based on a Hirshfeld surface analysis and related fingerprint plots{,} specific contact points and their distribution are identified which allows classification of different structural groups. Comparing the fingerprint plots with corresponding molecular properties such as electrostatic contour plots as well as quadrupole and polarizability tensors{,} which were calculated by density functional theory{,} allows rationalizing structure determining specific intermolecular interactions. Our analysis shows in particular that molecules with uniform electrostatic potential at their periphery favor a herringbone packing{,} while the highly electronegative substituents (O{,} N and F) enable the formation of H-bonds and prefer slip-stacking or criss-cross packing motifs. The present correlations might be useful guidelines for future strategies to synthesis new OSCs."

Dielectrics compatible with large area fabrication were explored to facilitate low cost electronics on glass or flexible plastic substrates. Transistors were realized on plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposited (PECVD) silicon nitride, silicon oxide and spin casted poly vinyl phenol (PVP). The physical and chemical properties of the dielectric have a distinct influence on the morphology and the structural properties of the pentacene films. Polycrystalline films with large crystals and high structural order can be grown on smooth dielectrics. For rougher dielectrics the crystal size is reduced and the films exhibit no structural order. Furthermore, the growth is affected by the surface wetting properties of the dielectric. The surface chemistry can be controlled by a treatment of the dielectric with self-assembled monolayers (SAMS). The impact of the different dielectrics on the device parameters like mobility and subthreshold slope will be discussed.}

This occurs from the view point of both the morphological coverage and optical phase retardation. Until a value of 2Å/s, as the deposition rate increases, the alignment of pentacene molecules, examined by optical retardation improves due to the guaranteed diffusion process for more stable positioning and an improved packing density at an early stage. The corresponding mobility is found to be proportional to the deposition rate in this regime. For increased deposition rates above 2Å/s, due to the shortage of diffusion processing time, evaporating pentacene molecules damage the pre-deposited and pre-aligned pentacene molecules on the anisotropic insulator. Thus, the optical retardation starts to decrease definitely when the early stage packing density is saturated. The resultant mobility is found to be inversely proportional to the deposition rate. Based on the morphological, optical results and the corresponding mobility, we confirm that the deposition rate of an organic semiconductor has a critical effect on the structural orientation, the molecular growth, and the resultant mobility in organic TFTs.}

To this end we present new density functional theory based calculations of the electron transfer parameter defining these models. Specifically{,} we report electronic coupling matrix elements for several ten thousand configurations that are thermally accessible to the C60 molecules through rotational diffusion around their lattice sites. We find that the root-mean-square fluctuations of the electronic coupling matrix element (11 meV) are almost as large as the average value (14 meV) and that the distribution is well approximated by a Gaussian. Importantly{,} due to the small reorganisation energy of the C60 dimer (≈0.1 eV){,} the ET is almost activationless for the majority of configurations. Yet{,} for a small but significant fraction of orientations the coupling is so strong compared to reorganisation energy that no charge-localised state exists{,} a situation that is aggravated if zero-point motion of the nuclei is taken into account. The present calculations indicate that standard hopping models do not provide a sound description of electron transport in C60{,} which might be the case for many other organics as well{,} and that approaches are needed that solve the electron dynamics directly."

	abstract = {Abstract We describe here a general Amber force field (GAFF) for organic molecules. GAFF is designed to be compatible with existing Amber force fields for proteins and nucleic acids, and has parameters for most organic and pharmaceutical molecules that are composed of H, C, N, O, S, P, and halogens. It uses a simple functional form and a limited number of atom types, but incorporates both empirical and heuristic models to estimate force constants and partial atomic charges. The performance of GAFF in test cases is encouraging. In test I, 74 crystallographic structures were compared to GAFF minimized structures, with a root-mean-square displacement of 0.26 Å, which is comparable to that of the Tripos 5.2 force field (0.25 Å) and better than those of MMFF 94 and CHARMm (0.47 and 0.44 Å, respectively). In test II, gas phase minimizations were performed on 22 nucleic acid base pairs, and the minimized structures and intermolecular energies were compared to MP2/6-31G* results. The RMS of displacements and relative energies were 0.25 Å and 1.2 kcal/mol, respectively. These data are comparable to results from Parm99/RESP (0.16 Å and 1.18 kcal/mol, respectively), which were parameterized to these base pairs. Test III looked at the relative energies of 71 conformational pairs that were used in development of the Parm99 force field. The RMS error in relative energies (compared to experiment) is about 0.5 kcal/mol. GAFF can be applied to wide range of molecules in an automatic fashion, making it suitable for rational drug design and database searching. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = "Three parallel algorithms for classical molecular dynamics are presented. The first assigns each processor a fixed subset of atoms; the second assigns each a fixed subset of inter-atomic forces to compute; the third assigns each a fixed spatial region. The algorithms are suitable for molecular dynamics models which can be difficult to parallelize efficiently—those with short-range forces where the neighbors of each atom change rapidly. They can be implemented on any distributed-memory parallel machine which allows for message-passing of data between independently executing processors. The algorithms are tested on a standard Lennard-Jones benchmark problem for system sizes ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel supercomputers--the nCUBE 2, Intel iPSC/860 and Paragon, and Cray T3D. Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Cray Y-MP and C90 algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel machines is competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even for small problems. For large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves parallel efficiencies of 90% and a 1840-node Intel Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Cray C9O processor. Trade-offs between the three algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more complex molecular dynamics simulations are also discussed."

Samples were prepared by melt quenching, spray drying, ball milling, and cryo-milling. The resulting amorphous materials were characterised using X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. All freshly prepared samples were completely X-ray amorphous (with a halo being the only feature in the diffractograms). The shape of the halos in the diffractograms, however, varied depending on the preparation method, suggesting structural variations in the near order of the molecules between the differently prepared amorphous forms. Principal component analysis of the Raman spectra of the various amorphous forms revealed that the samples clustered in the scores plot according to preparation method, again suggesting structural differences due to preparation method. The range of vibrations associated with the largest spectral differences in the loadings plot showed that these differences were due to a range of molecular conformations and intermolecular interactions. The ranking of the samples with respect to stability was: quench cooled amorphous samples>cryo-milled (α-form)>spray dried>ball milled (α-form)>ball milled (γ-form)=cryo-milled (γ-form). This ranking was not correlated with the diffractogram shapes or sample distribution in the scores plot of the Raman spectra, suggesting that physical stability was not directly affected by structural variation in the samples. However, ranking of stability of the differently prepared amorphous forms of the drug could be predicted by determining the relaxation time values, for all amorphous samples. The relaxation times, calculated by using the Adam Gibbs and Kohlrausch–Williams–Watts equations, were in accordance with the experimentally determined stability order. This study showed that correlation of physical stability with calculated relaxation time is possible for the same amorphous systems prepared by different methods. This could aid in selecting the most appropriate preparation techniques in situations where there are a variety of suitable methods."

Compared to the narrower x-ray amorphous range for this system obtained through melt-quenching as found in this study, 0.50≤x≤0.67, the x-ray amorphous range for this system could be extended from the low-alkali ultra-thiophosphate composition of x ~0.25 to slightly above the high-alkali pyro-thiophosphate composition of x ~0.70 using mechanical milling. Mechanically milled samples with Na2S of composition x=0.75 yielded a partially crystalline material that had diffuse XRD peaks associated to the α-Na3PS4 phase. A similar result was obtained for the x=0.80 composition except that, as expected, it also showed peaks for unreacted (over stoichiometric) Na2S. The melt-quenched and mechanically milled samples with the same compositions 0.50≤x≤0.67 showed similar FT-IR and Raman spectra, indicating very similar chemical short-range structures are present in both of these amorphous materials. It was found that the Na2S+P2S5 system exhibited similar behavior to that of the Li2S+P2S5 in that chemical reaction between Na2S and P2S5 could be induced by mechanical milling near room temperature to produce both amorphous and polycrystalline materials."

In all cases, Tg of the ternary system was lower than the Tg   of the binary system, although higher than that of the individual third       component. Upon storage for 4 weeks, all created ternary systems showed       significantly smaller variation in Tg compared to the binary system. Stable   three-component co-amorphous systems can be generated via melt-quench method  using either a crystalline or an amorphous third component. Addition of third component can alter the Tg of co-amorphous system and in all cases created    more stable co-amorphous system upon storage. Physical parameters may not be  sufficient in predicting the resulting Tg; therefore, knowledge of chemical   interaction must be brought into equation as well.},

The method is based on the quasi-classical interpretation of the nuclear wave function, whose phase is related to the classical momentum and whose density is represented in terms of classical trajectories. In this approximation, electronic decoherence is naturally induced as effect of the coupling to the nuclei and correctly reproduces the expected quantum behaviour. Moreover, the splitting of the nuclear wave packet is captured as consequence of the correct approximation of the time-dependent potential of the theory. This new approach offers a clear improvement over Ehrenfest-like dynamics. The theoretical derivation presented in the Letter is supported by numerical results that are compared to quantum mechanical calculations.},

We also find that the cohesive energy increases in the order body-centered-cubic {\textless} hexagonal {\textless} simple cubic {\textless} monoclinic {\textless} triclinic, independently of the type of dispersion correction used.

The simulations beneﬁt from a newly implemented state tracking algorithm that accounts for trivial surface crossings and from a projection algorithm that removes decoherence correction-induced artiﬁcial long-range charge transfer. The CT mechanism changes from slow hopping of a fully localized charge to fast diﬀusion of a polaron delocalized over several molecules as electronic coupling between the molecules exceeds the critical threshold V ≥ λ/2 (λ is the reorganization energy). With increasing temperature, the polaron becomes more localized and the mobility exhibits a “band-like” power law decay due to increased site energy and electronic coupling ﬂuctuations (local and nonlocal electron− phonon coupling). Thus, reducing both types of electron−phonon coupling while retaining high mean electronic couplings should be part of the strategy toward discovery of new organics with high room-temperature mobilities.},

	abstract = {Charge transport in crystalline organic semiconductors is intrinsically limited by the presence of large thermal molecular motions, which are a direct consequence of the weak van der Waals intermolecular interactions. These lead to an original regime of transport called transient localization, sharing features of both localized and itinerant electron systems. After a brief review of experimental observations that pose a challenge to the theory, we concentrate on a commonly studied model which describes the interaction of the charge carriers with intermolecular vibrations. We present different theoretical approaches that have been applied to the problem in the past, and then turn to more modern approaches that are able to capture the key microscopic phenomenon at the origin of the puzzling experimental observations, i.e., the quantum localization of the electronic wavefunction at timescales shorter than the typical molecular motions. We describe in particular a relaxation time approximation which clarifies how the transient localization due to dynamical molecular motions relates to the Anderson localization realized for static disorder, and allows us to devise strategies to improve the mobility of actual compounds. The relevance of the transient localization scenario to other classes of systems is briefly discussed.},

The polaron propagates through the crystal by diffusive jumps over several lattice spacings at a time during which it expands more than twice its size. Computed values for polaron size and charge mobility are in excellent agreement with experimental estimates and correlate very well with the recently proposed transient localization theory.},

A major challenge for any such mixed quantum-classical approach is feedback; the quantum and classical degrees of freedom must respond to each other properly and self-consistently. This paper examines a number of mixed quantum-classical strategies, includeing mean-field (Ehrenfest) and surface-hopping, with particular attention to the issue of feedback. Each of the methods dicussed has deficiencies, and none displays universal superiority. Directions for further progress are suggested. Nevertheless, the mixed quantum-classical approach has greatly exteneded the range of chemical processes that can be addressed accurately and practically by molecular dynamics simulation.},

The relation allows the prediction and measurement of early time decoherence dynamics for any open quantum system, through purity, without reconstructing the system’s many-body density matrix. It is applied to predict the decoherence time for basic modelsthe Holstein chain, spinboson and Caldeira-Legget modelscommonly employed to capture electronic, vibrational, and vibronic dynamics in molecules. Such development also oﬀers a practical platform to test the ability of approximate quantum dynamics methods to capture decoherence. In particular, a class of mixed quantum-classical schemes for molecular dynamics where the bath is treated classically, such as Ehrenfest dynamics, are shown to correctly capture short-time decoherence when the initial conditions are sampled from the Wigner distribution. These advances provide a useful platform to develop decoherence times for molecular processes and to test approximate molecular dynamics methods.},

The algorithm has the structure of Ehrenfest equations plus a “coupled-trajectory” term for both the electronic and nuclear equations, and we analyze the relative roles played by the diﬀerent nonadiabatic terms in these equations, including how they are computed in practice. In particular, we show that while the coupled-trajectory term in the electronic equation is essential in yielding accurate dynamics, that in the nuclear equation has a much smaller eﬀect. A decoherence time is extracted from the electronic equations and compared with that of augmented fewest-switches surfacehopping.

	abstract = {Abstract. Direct numerical approaches for the solution of the time-independent one-dimensional Schrödinger equation are discussed. Applications to multiquantum well (MQW) semiconductor heterostructure potentials need linear dependence of the computer time tcomp on the number of spatial grid points N. Although acknowledged as a very effective Fourier grid Hamiltonian (FGH) method, it has cubic dependence on the number of spatial grid points, i.e., tcomp ∼ N 3 , which limits its use to problems with a complexity of N ≤ 1000. A simple straightforward shooting method (ShM), which is based on trial stepping over the coordinate and energy, has the necessary tcomp ∼ N dependence with moderate energy convergence efficiency but the recommended symmetry preconditions and the not very clearly defined external boundaries make its application inconvenient. This paper offers a new reliable and effective energy and wave function coupled solution (EWC) method with a Newton iteration scheme and an internal bordered tridiagonal matrix solver. The method has a linear distribution tasks with tcomp ∼ N dependence complexity up to N = and may by applied 105 and beyond. Zero to or arbitrary potential energy cyclic boundary conditions may be specified for the wave function. For versatile MQW tasks the combined use of ShM and EWC is illustrated. Detailed accuracy and computer time comparisons show that the combined ShM + EWC method is three orders of magnitude more effective than the FGH method.},

In this report, analytical relations underpinning the two methods are derived within the adiabatic basis to provide an implementation-level overview, with particular attention given to two avoidable sources of energy conservation deviation. It is not widely known that accuracy improvements can be obtained at negligible computational expense by allowing: (a) construction of the Schrödinger equation to account for analytic electronic phase propagation, and (b) inclusion of a Hellman–Feynman correctional term in the calculation of atomic forces. Particular emphasis on the algebraic formalism contrasts these inherent approximations, vis-à-vis the correctional approaches. The sensitivity of energy conservation with respect to phase propagation is exemplified by simulation of Xe molecular photodissociation on the repulsive Π(1/2) u excited surface. Simulations of a representative two-state avoided crossing system are presented to exemplify analytic quantities of the mean-field and surface-hopping approaches as well as to illustrate the inclusion of the Hellman–Feynman correctional term. Nonadiabatic propagation of the molecular wavefunction is observed by monitoring ground and excited state occupational probabilities, energy conservation, and nonadiabatic coupling as the system evolves along the model potential energy surfaces.},

	abstract = {We have recently introduced an efficient semi-empirical non-adiabatic molecular dynamics method for the simulation of charge transfer/transport in molecules and molecular materials, denoted fragment orbital-based surface hopping (FOB-SH) [J. Spencer et al., J. Chem. Phys. 145, 064102 (2016)]. In this method, the charge carrier wavefunction is expanded in a set of charge localized, diabatic electronic states and propagated in the time-dependent potential due to classical nuclear motion. Here we derive and implement an exact expression for the non-adiabatic coupling vectors between the adiabatic electronic states in terms of nuclear gradients of the diabatic electronic states. With the non-adiabatic coupling vectors (NACVs) available, we investigate how different flavours of fewest switches surface hopping affect detailed balance, internal consistency, and total energy conservation for electron hole transfer in a molecular dimer with two electronic states. We find that FOB-SH satisfies detailed balance across a wide range of diabatic electronic coupling strengths provided that the velocities are adjusted along the direction of the NACV to satisfy total energy conservation upon a surface hop. This criterion produces the right fraction of energy-forbidden (frustrated) hops, which is essential for correct population of excited states, especially when diabatic couplings are on the order of the thermal energy or larger, as in organic semiconductors and DNA. Furthermore, we find that FOB-SH is internally consistent, that is, the electronic surface population matches the average quantum amplitudes, but only in the limit of small diabatic couplings. For large diabatic couplings, inconsistencies are observed as the decrease in excited state population due to frustrated hops is not matched by a corresponding decrease in quantum amplitudes. The derivation provided here for the NACV should be generally applicable to any electronic structure approach where the electronic Hamiltonian is constructed in a diabatic electronic state basis.},

Within traditional semiclassical or mixed quantum−classical dynamics, the coupling between quantum electronic states and classical nuclear trajectories is governed by nonadiabatic coupling vectors coupled to classical nuclear momenta. This enables us to develop a very powerful nonadiabatic dynamics algorithm, namely, surface hopping dynamics, which can describe the splitting of nuclear wave packets and detailed balance. Despite its eﬃciency and practicality, it suﬀers from the lack of quantum decoherence due to incorrect accounts for the electron−nuclear coupling. Here we present a new surface hopping algorithm based on the exact electron−nuclear correlation from the exact factorization of molecular wave functions. This algorithm demands comparable computational costs to existing surface hopping methods. Numerical simulations with two-state models and a multidimensional multistate realistic molecule show that the electron−nuclear coupling beyond the nonadiabatic coupling terms can describe the quantum coherence properly.},

The method is based on the quasi-classical interpretation of the nuclear wave function, whose phase is related to the classical momentum and whose density is represented in terms of classical trajectories. In this approximation, electronic decoherence is naturally induced as effect of the coupling to the nuclei and correctly reproduces the expected quantum behaviour. Moreover, the splitting of the nuclear wave packet is captured as consequence of the correct approximation of the time-dependent potential of the theory. This new approach offers a clear improvement over Ehrenfest-like dynamics.

	abstract = {We present a new algorithm for mixed quantum-classical dynamics that helps bridge the gap between mean-field (Ehrenfest) and surface-hopping dynamics by defining a natural rate of decoherence. In order to derive this decoherence result, we have expanded the number of independent variables in the usual Ehrenfest routine so that mixed quantum-classical derivatives are now propagated in time alongside the usual Ehrenfest variables. Having done so, we compute a unique rate of decoherence using two independent approaches: (i) by comparing the equations of motion for the joint nuclear-electronic probability density in phase space according to Ehrenfest dynamics versus partial Wigner transform dynamics and (ii) by introducing a frozen Gaussian interpretation of Ehrenfest dynamics which allows nuclear wave packets to separate. The first consequence of this work is a means to rigorously check the accuracy of standard Ehrenfest dynamics. Second, this paper suggests a nonadiabatic dynamics algorithm, whereby the nuclei are propagated on the mean-field (Ehrenfest) potential energy surface and undergo stochastic decoherence events. Our work resembles the surface-hopping algorithm of Schwartz and co-workers [J. Chem. Phys. 123, 234106 (2005)]—only now without any adjustable parameters. For the case of two electronic states, we present numerical results on the so-called “Tully problems” and emphasize that future numerical benchmarking is still needed. Future work will also treat the problem of three or more electronic states.},

	abstract = {A number of methods have been developed to introduce quantum mechanical effects into an otherwise classical mechanical molecular dynamics framework. Theses methods can be applied to processes involving tunneling and quantuisation of atomic motion on a single potential energy surface. A major challenge for any such mixed quantum-classical approach is feedback; the quantum and classical degrees of freedom must respond to each other properly and self-consistently. This paper examines a number of mixed quantum-classical strategies, includeing mean-field (Ehrenfest) and surface-hopping, with particular attention to the issue of feedback. Each of the methods dicussed has deficiencies, and none displays universal superiority. Directions for further progress are suggested. Nevertheless, the mixed quantum-classical approach has greatly exteneded the range of chemical processes that can be addressed accurately and practically by molecular dynamics simulation.},

	    abstract = { We present a current, up-to-date review of the surface hopping methodology for solving nonadiabatic problems, 25 years after Tully published the fewest switches surface hopping algorithm. After reviewing the original motivation for and failures of the algorithm, we give a detailed examination of modern advances, focusing on both theoretical and practical issues. We highlight how one can partially derive surface hopping from the Schrödinger equation in the adiabatic basis, how one can change basis within the surface hopping algorithm, and how one should understand and apply the notions of decoherence and wavepacket bifurcation. The question of time reversibility and detailed balance is also examined at length. Recent applications to photoexcited conjugated polymers are discussed briefly. }

This theoretical work provides a clear explanation for the origin of the high mobilities.},
