Intro:
  * Why have semi-classical sims? Why treat nuclei classically? What is the
    BO approximation? Why is the BO approximation sometimes invalid? What sort
    of systems is it invalid in?

  * What are the alternatives to semi-classical simulations? Hopping theory basics -maybe I don't need to mention band theory as I've not used it...

  * What is non-adiabatic MD? Why is it needed? Why use CTMQC and not another
    method?

  * How does CTMQC work -it is Ehrenfest + QM.

  * What is the meaning of each term in the CTMQC equations and how do they
    affect the dynamics?

    + QM only active during mixing of populations -clumps nuclei together, acts
      to collapse the WF with the ad_mom.
    + ad_mom is similar to the QM.
    + dlk causes the initial mixing of the populations
    + H is the hamiltonian and in the diab basis it causes mixing it also
      contains energies etc...
      .
      .
      .

  * What other techinques are available -i.e. surface hopping.
    + How does it work.
    + How does it differ from CTMQC
    + What can it be applied to -it's shortcomings

  * Anything to do with Electrostatics?
    + Direct Coulomb Sum -conditionally convergent, very slow
    + Ewald -absolutely convergent, slow
    + DSF -absolutely convergent, approximation, very quick
    + Addition-subtraction.


What have I done?
    CHAPTER 1
  * Implemented CTMQC for the 1D, 1 atom Tully Models.

    This was first implemented as standalone code in python then integrated into
    CP2K.

    This chapter should only discuss the adiabatic propagation and the results
    of that.

    - How was this implemented?
        # What are the Tully Models? How to calculate the properties?

        # Make a flow chart of the main parts of the code and the dependencies of
          each variable.

        # Wigner distribution

    - How was the data verified/tested?
        # Norm conservation

        # Rabi oscillation

        # Numerical tests
            + Eq S26
            + X_qmll diagonal thing

        # Comparison to literature
            + Models 1, 2, 3 and 4
            + high and low mom

        # Comparison to Subotnik
          + Models 1, 2 and 3
          + high and low mom


    - The results match the literature results well. There are many conclusions
      to be drawn from this mini-project:

        # The calculation of the quantum momentum is dependent on the sigma,
          which is hard to parameterise. It could in theory be done via
          numerical methods such as geom opt, though in practice this would make
          a simulation infeasibly expensive.

        # The QM suffers from large diveregences in one of the terms that is
          used in its calculation... These can be fixed in the Tully models.

        # CTMQC works well if well parameterised.

        # The adiabatic momentum must be reset after the adiabatic populations
          fully decohere.


    CHAPTER 2
  * Transformed equations from adiabatic to diabatic basis and implemented for
    molecular systems (diabatic propagation).

    This was implemented in CP2K in the diabatic basis (built upon the Tully
    Model code).

    This chapter should discuss the basis transformation as well as the findings
    from the molecular systems.

    - How was it implemented?
        # What is AOM:
            + AOM gives an analytic way to calculate the Hamiltonian and
              nonadiabtic couplings via the overlap of SOMOs.

            + It is very fast and is used in the group in surface hopping and
              CTMQC.

        # How to implement CTMQC in the diabatic basis for AOM compatibility.
            + Make a flow chart of the code, showing what changes from the Tully
              models in order to simulate molecular systems.

            + Show equations and their derivation.

    - Does it work? Why not?
        # Spikes increase in frequency with more complex systems.

        # Can't parametrise the sigma value reliably.

        # Bad norm conservation.


      CHAPTER 3
    * Helped optimise surface hopping code. This was mostly coded up by Sam, but
      I helped by discussing and doing bits of coding. RK4 optimisation, memory
      profiling, speed profiling, speed up the NACE calculation.

      - Sped up the code by:
        # Optimising the RK4 propagator
        # Profiling memory and help determine the memory problem with the
          multiple force_env sections.
        # Re-wrote the NACE calculation to use LAPACK and split triple matrix
          multiplications into 2 matrix-matrix multiplications.

      - Used these speed ups to apply the code to larger systems... Amorphous
        Pentacene.

    * Implemented the electrostatics in surface hopping.
        - Why is it important? ES is vital to many systems such as polar molecules
          or amorphous/semi-crystalline systems.
          # Can show the collapse of the pentacene systems with and without the
            electrostaics implemented.
        - What schemes are available? What are the problems with each scheme and
          what are the advantages of each? Ewald is formally (classically) exact
          but expensive. DSF is an approximation but very cheap and probably a
          good one.
        - Implemented Ewald equations with a trick to efficiently calculate the
          full ES for a Nmol system.
          # Need to explain how surface hopping work with site-energies etc...
          # Need to explain why implementing ES the naive way is way too expensive (loop Nmol times)
        - Implemented DSF with addition-subtraction trick to speed things up even
          further.
          # What is the DSF method?
          # Why is it faster than Ewald? -Recip not used...
        - Show speed up between DSF, Ewald and re-calculating for every state
        - Show difference in results with DSF, Ewald and re-calculating for every
          state

    * How were things tested?
        - Tested against FIST with 1 mol in charge state.
        - Tested against simply re-calculating the ES for every charge state.
        - Tested for


       CHAPTER 4
     * Amorphous and semi-crystalline pentacene is important to study, as in real
       systems the pentacene structure is rarely perfectly crystalline.
     * How did I make the systems?
        - Melted at 800K, Quenched over various timescales.
        - Longer timescales result in more ordered systems.
        - Electrostatic interactions are very important as without these the classic
          Herringbone packing doesn't form.
        - Can result in very high couplings without ES -can show coupling networks.
     * How did I parameterise the systems?
        - Used GAFF...
        - Partial Charges from Gaussian (B3LYP with 6-311G(d))
     * Applied surface hopping to large amorphous systems.
        - Required the speed-ups and electrostatics in the previous chapter.
     * More to come.
