\section{Charge Transfer Properties}
We have seen that the final structure of the pentacene systems becomes more ordered and crystal-like as the quenching time is increased. It would be good now to see how this affects the charge transfer properties. A key quantity governing charge transfer rates is the ratio between electronic coupling and reorganisation energy, $\frac{H_{ab}}{\lambda}$. Seeing as we have a single molecule system, by plotting the electronic coupling we can get a qualitative view of the charge transfer dynamics and see which paths are the most likely within the structure.
\subsection{Global Couplings}
\begin{figure}[ht]

The black dashed lines represent the maximum coupling within a perfect pentacene crystal.}
\end{figure}
\noindent The global coupling distribution gives an overview of the values of coupling within the system, hence an idea of the charge transport properties of the system. To calculate these couplings I have used the analytic overlap method (AOM)\cite{gajdos_ultrafast_2014} to calculate couplings between all pairs of molecules (using a nearest neighbour cutoff) in the final snapshot of each quenched system. As can be seen from figure \ref{fig:glob_coup} as the quench time increases a knee starts to form in the distribution at a high coupling value ($~80 meV$), this is especially obvious in the 100ns quench structure (red curve). The figure also highlights the importance of electrostatics in the formation of the correct structure. The purple line shows the coupling distribution for the same simulation except electrostatics were switched off. In this curve we see far more very high values of coupling -substantially higher than those seen in the perfect crystal. This is due to it now being favourable to form a more tightly packed face-to-face structure giving rise to larger molecular overlaps hence higher couplings.
\subsection{Coupling Graphs}
\label{sect:couplGraphs}
\begin{figure}[ht]
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./img/CouplingPlots/CouplingGraphs_all.png}
	\caption{\label{fig:crystalCouplingGraph}A representative network of electronic coupling that each quenched structure has formed. Each structure is labelled by the quench time (e.g. 0ns, 1ns, 10ns, 100ns) or Crystal for a crystal after a short MD equilibration. Coupling strengths are categorised as high (red), medium (green) and low (blue). The definitions of the categories are given in the legend in the bottom right corner.}
\end{figure}
\noindent In figure \ref{fig:crystalCouplingGraph} the graph of electronic couplings between molecules has been plotted for each of the quenched systems and a crystal system after a short equilibration run with MD. In this figure the centers of mass each molecule is represented by a small black dot and the calculated coupling value with a coloured line (red, green blue). That is, if 2 molecules have a non-negligible coupling between them they would be represented by 2 black dots with either a red, green or blue line connecting them. The couplings were calculated via the analytic overlap method \cite{gajdos_ultrafast_2014} and a pertinent cluster of molecules was selected for each quench time. For the 0ns and 1ns quench times this was simply a slice 1 molecule thick in the z dimension, containing a few hundred molecules. For the 10ns and 100ns quenched structures a reasonable cluster of molecules was chosen after applying a density based clustering algorithm on the superstructure. For the crystal a plane from the crystal was chosen. All panes in figure \ref{fig:crystalCouplingGraph} show the coupling of the selected system from an angle perpendicular to the plane of molecules.
\\\\
We can see in the graph of the 0ns quenched structure there is very little order to the coupling network. Only very small fragments of high (red) coupling are formed and each one is connected via weak or medium coupling. We can define a 'high coupling fragment' as any set of molecules which can all be reached from any member of the set via an unbroken path of high coupling. The mean size of these high coupling fragments in the 0ns structure is 4.1 molecules and there are 503 of them. In this structure we would expect to see a localised polaron (over a $\sim$ 3 molecules) and low mobilities due to the lack of conductive channels in the structure. The mean size of fragments increases and the number of fragments decreases as we increase the quenching time as shown in table \ref{tab:cluster_sizes}.
\\
\begin{table}[ht]
	\begin{tabular}{cccc}
		\textbf{Quench Time} [ns] & \textbf{Mean Fragment Size} & \textbf{Fragment Size Std Dev} & \textbf{Num Fragments} \\
		\hline &&&\\
		0 & 4.2 & 3.8 & 503 \\
		1 & 4.5 & 5.0 & 493 \\
		10 & 6.5 & 9.3 & 373 \\
		100 & 8.7 & 16.2 & 292 \\
		\hline &&&\\
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{\label{tab:cluster_sizes}The change in the number of high coupling fragments, and the mean and standard deviation of their size, found in each structure as the quenching time was varied.}
\end{table}
\\
We can see in table \ref{tab:cluster_sizes} that as the quenching time increases, the size of the highly coupled fragments (how many molecules are connected) increases and fewer of them are formed. The standard deviation also increases showing in the 0ns quenched structure most fragments are very small but as we increase the quench time we still get smaller fragments but much larger ones can now form too. These larger fragments can act as regions of high conductivity allowing much larger mobilities to be achieved than in the quicker quenching times.

\subsection{Hole Mobilities}
\label{sect:mobilities}
To properly quantify the charge transfer dynamics the electron-hole mobility can be calculated on the output of a surface hopping simulation. A full discussion of the calculation of the electron mobility can be found here in Giannini, 19 \cite{Giannini2019}. The mean squared displacement (MSD) of the charge carrier wavefunction was calculated and the gradient found by fitting a straight line to this. The gradient of the MSD, which is proportional to the Einstein diffusion coefficient D, was then used to calculate the mobility as in equation \eqref{eq:mobility} below.
\begin{equation}
	\mu_{ij} = \frac{e D_{ij}}{k_{B} T}
	\label{eq:mobility}
\end{equation}
Where $D_{ij}$ represents the Einstein diffusion coefficient, $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant, $e$ the elementary charge and $T$ is the temperature.
\subsection{Simulation Set up}
\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.38\textwidth}
	\vspace*{-0.7cm}

	\includegraphics[width=0.14\textwidth]{./img/RestraintsPos.png}
	\caption{\label{fig:rest}The restraint set up for 1 molecule. Each coloured zig-zag shows the atoms that are restrained.}
\end{wrapfigure}
\vspace*{0.5cm}
The surface hopping simulations require a swarm of hundreds of independent trajectories ($\sim$200), each with slightly different positions and velocities to fully sample phase space. The code currently does not support electrostatic interactions, so, in order to maintain the structure from the molecular dynamics simulations, center of mass restraints were used on each molecule. The restraint set up for 1 molecule is shown in figure \ref{fig:rest}. Here each of the 4 coloured zig-zag shapes show which atoms are restrained. These atoms were restrained about their center of mass. This configuration of restraints was used in order to stop rotations about the long axis for each molecule as this would allow molecules to form a face-to-face stacking giving rise to unphysically high couplings. The restraint strength was chosen to be the same as in another group members study to allow for a fair comparison of results. A short MD equilibration was performed to determine whether the restraint spring constant was sufficient to hold the molecules in place well enough to prevent the very high couplings appearing in the global coupling distribution. To further validate the choice of restraint/general set up a surface hopping simulation was carried out on a layer of bulk crystal and the mobilities were compared to known values.
\\\\
In order to obtain initial positions and velocities for the individual trajectories an MD equilibration was carried out using the restraint set up. This was carried out for 220ps using the NVE ensemble. The first 4ps were discarded and positions and velocities were then sampled every 1ps in order to get 216 trajectories. When these 216 trajectories were created, the Hamiltonian was calculated for each. This allowed and adiabatic state to be selected which, when transformed to the diabatic basis gave a population close to the center of the system and had an energy within 3KT of the ground state energy. An explanation of how this was done is given in appendix \ref{ap:AdiabaticSelector}. In short the method consisted of finding the adiabatic energy (eigenvalue) and diabatic populations (eigenvector) corresponding to adiabatic state n which yielded a state both close to the center and within approximately 3KT of the ground state energy. This was done to ensure a quick convergence of the mean squared displacement of the charge carrier. The surface hopping simulations were then carried out with initial positions and velocities coming from the NVE equilibration run and the initial wavefunction being selected as mentioned above. Other parameters were taken from previous surface hopping simulations carried out by other members of the group.

\subsubsection{0ns and 1ns Systems}
\begin{figure}[ht]
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./img/DifferentQuenchTimes/0ns/0nsSubsystems.png}
	\caption{\label{fig:0nsSubSys}Panel a) shows a system chosen to run surface hopping on, molecules in gray are fixed in place blue molecules show the active region. Panel b) shows every substructure chosen in the 0ns quenched structure.}
\end{figure}
The selection of the region for each surface hopping simulation was important in order to get a fair representation of the mobilities achievable within each structure. In the 0ns and 1ns quenched structures 6 slices were selected from the final snapshot of the structure. These were chosen to be independent clusters evenly spaced to sample the mobility of the structure at various points. The selections are shown in figure \ref{fig:0nsSubSys} for the 0ns quenched structure. The same process was used in the 1ns quenched structure.
\\\\
In order to preserve the structure and maintain energy conservation a shell of inactive molecules was selected from the superstructure to surround the active region. The atoms within this remained fixed to their position at t=0.
\subsection{100ns System}
\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./img/DifferentQuenchTimes/100ns/AllClusters_labelled.png}
	\caption{\label{fig:100nsClusteredLabelled}The 100ns quenched structure clustered by layer. Each different colour represents a different cluster, labelled with the numbers around the edge of the structure.}
\end{figure}
The 100ns system is a much more ordered system and forms very well defined layers. This makes picking out structures on which to run surface hopping different to the 0/1ns quenched structures. The method I used was to first extend the superstructure in the z axis by $\pm45 \angstrom$ by repeating the periodic image and discarding molecules more than $\pm45 \angstrom$ from the simulation box boundaries. This was to ensure the resulting system was sufficiently large to converge mobilities. This added approximately 1 extra periodic image in the $+^{\text{ve}}$ and $-^{\text{ve}}$ z direction. A density based clustering algorithm (similar to DBSCAN \cite{DBSCAN}) was used to isolate the layers in the full structure by clustering centers of mass. These are shown in figure \ref{fig:100nsClusteredLabelled}. In this figure clusters 6, 7 and 11 were chosen to calculate the mobility via surface hopping.

\subsection{10ns System}
\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.38\textwidth}
	\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{./img/DifferentQuenchTimes/10ns/Clusters.png}
	\caption{\label{fig:10nsClusters}The clusters chosen to run surface hopping simulations on. The coloured clusters each represent a different structure on which surface hopping was ran.}
\end{wrapfigure}
The choice of region within the 10ns quenched structure was different from the 0/1ns and the 100ns quenched structure. Here we have some large crystal fragments forming but still very few well defined layers. In this system the mobility is expected to be much more dependant on the initial position of the charge carrier within the structure than in the 0ns and 100ns quenched structure where the structure was more uniformly disordered or ordered respectively. In order to sample a reasonable range of mobilities in this structure 4 clusters were selected shown in fig \ref{fig:10nsClusters}. 3 of these (red, blue and purple) were selected using a similar clustering procedure as in the 100ns quenched structure. The center-right green cluster was selected as it looked like it was a fairly disordered region where multiple crystal fragments meet, which would give a lower bound on the mobility within the 10ns structure.
