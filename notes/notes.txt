Intro:
  * Why have semi-classical sims? Why make treat nuclei classical? What is the
    BO approximation? Why is the BO approximation sometimes invalid? What sort
    of systems is it invalid in?

  * What is non-adiabatic MD? Why is it needed? Why use CTMQC and not another
    method?

  * How does CTMQC work -it is Ehrenfest + QM.

  * What is the meaning of each term in the CTMQC equations and how do they
    affect the dynamics?

    + QM only active during mixing of populations -clumps nuclei together, acts
      to collapse the WF with the ad_mom.
    + ad_mom is similar to the QM.
    + dlk causes the initial mixing of the populations
    + H is the hamiltonian and in the diab basis it causes mixing it also
      contains energies etc...

What have I done?
    CHAPTER 1
  * Implemented CTMQC for the 1D, 1 atom Tully Models.

    This was first implemented as standalone code in python then integrated into
    CP2K.

    This chapter should only discuss the adiabatic propagation and the results
    of that.

    - How was this implemented?
        # What are the Tully Models? How to calculate the properties?

        # Make a flow chart of the main parts of the code and the dependencies of
          each variable.

        # Wigner distribution

    - How was the data verified/tested?
        # Norm conservation

        # Rabi oscillation

        # Numerical tests
            + Eq S26
            + X_qmll diagonal thing

        # Comparison to literature
            + Models 1, 2, 3 and 4
            + high and low mom

        # Comparison to Subotnik
          + Models 1, 2 and 3
          + high and low mom


    - The results match the literature results well. There are many conclusions
      to be drawn from this mini-project:

        # The calculation of the quantum momentum is dependent on the sigma,
          which is hard to parameterise. It could in theory be done via
          numerical methods such as geom opt, though in practice this would make
          a simulation infeasibly expensive.

        # The QM suffers from large diveregences in one of the terms that is
          used in its calculation... These can be fixed in the Tully models.

        # CTMQC works well if well parameterised.

        # The adiabatic momentum must be reset after the adiabatic populations
          fully decohere.


    CHAPTER 2
  * Transformed equations from adiabatic to diabatic basis and implemented for
    molecular systems (diabatic propagation).

    This was implemented in CP2K in the diabatic basis (built upon the Tully
    Model code).

    This chapter should discuss the basis transformation as well as the findings
    from the molecular systems.

    - How was it implemented?
        # What is AOM:
            + AOM gives an analytic way to calculate the Hamiltonian and
              nonadiabtic couplings via the overlap of SOMOs.

            + It is very fast and is used in the group in surface hopping and
              CTMQC.

        # How to implement CTMQC in the diabatic basis for AOM compatibility.
            + Make a flow chart of the code, showing what changes from the Tully
              models in order to simulate molecular systems.

            + Show equations and their derivation.

    - Does it work? Why not?
        # Spikes increase in frequency with more complex systems.

        # Can't parametrise the sigma value reliably.

        # Bad norm conservation.


      CHAPTER 3
    * Helped optimise surface hopping code. This was mostly coded up by Sam, but
      I helped by discussing and doing bits of coding. RK4 optimisation, memory
      profiling, speed profiling, speed up the NACE calculation.

      - Sped up the code by:
        # Optimising the RK4 propagator
        # Profiling memory and help determine the memory problem with the
          multiple force_env sections.
        # Re-wrote the NACE calculation to use LAPACK and split triple matrix
          multiplications into 2 matrix-matrix multiplications.

      - Used these speed ups to apply the code to larger systems... Amorphous
        Pentacene.
