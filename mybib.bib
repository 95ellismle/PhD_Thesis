	abstract = {We present a novel quantum-classical approach to non-adiabatic dynamics, deduced from the coupled electronic and nuclear equations in the framework of the exact factorization of the electron-nuclear wave function. The method is based on the quasi-classical interpretation of the nuclear wave function, whose phase is related to the classical momentum and whose density is represented in terms of classical trajectories. In this approximation, electronic decoherence is naturally induced as effect of the coupling to the nuclei and correctly reproduces the expected quantum behaviour. Moreover, the splitting of the nuclear wave packet is captured as consequence of the correct approximation of the time-dependent potential of the theory. This new approach offers a clear improvement over Ehrenfest-like dynamics. The theoretical derivation presented in the Letter is supported by numerical results that are compared to quantum mechanical calculations.},

Here we use density functional theory to calculate electronic-coupling matrix elements, reorganization energies, and activation energies for available experimental and model crystal structures. We find that the picture of an excess electron hopping from one fullerene to another does not apply for any of the crystalline phases, rendering traditional rate equations inappropriate. We also find that the cohesive energy increases in the order body-centered-cubic {\textless} hexagonal {\textless} simple cubic {\textless} monoclinic {\textless} triclinic, independently of the type of dispersion correction used. Our results indicate that the coupled electron-ion dynamics needs to be solved explicitly to obtain a realistic description of charge transfer in this material.},

The simulations beneﬁt from a newly implemented state tracking algorithm that accounts for trivial surface crossings and from a projection algorithm that removes decoherence correction-induced artiﬁcial long-range charge transfer. The CT mechanism changes from slow hopping of a fully localized charge to fast diﬀusion of a polaron delocalized over several molecules as electronic coupling between the molecules exceeds the critical threshold V ≥ λ/2 (λ is the reorganization energy). With increasing temperature, the polaron becomes more localized and the mobility exhibits a “band-like” power law decay due to increased site energy and electronic coupling ﬂuctuations (local and nonlocal electron− phonon coupling). Thus, reducing both types of electron−phonon coupling while retaining high mean electronic couplings should be part of the strategy toward discovery of new organics with high room-temperature mobilities.},

	abstract = {A number of methods have been developed to introduce quantum mechanical effects into an otherwise classical mechanical molecular dynamics framework. Theses methods can be applied to processes involving tunneling and quantuisation of atomic motion on a single potential energy surface. A major challenge for any such mixed quantum-classical approach is feedback; the quantum and classical degrees of freedom must respond to each other properly and self-consistently. This paper examines a number of mixed quantum-classical strategies, includeing mean-field (Ehrenfest) and surface-hopping, with particular attention to the issue of feedback. Each of the methods dicussed has deficiencies, and none displays universal superiority. Directions for further progress are suggested. Nevertheless, the mixed quantum-classical approach has greatly exteneded the range of chemical processes that can be addressed accurately and practically by molecular dynamics simulation.},

It is applied to predict the decoherence time for basic modelsthe Holstein chain, spinboson and Caldeira-Legget modelscommonly employed to capture electronic, vibrational, and vibronic dynamics in molecules. Such development also oﬀers a practical platform to test the ability of approximate quantum dynamics methods to capture decoherence. In particular, a class of mixed quantum-classical schemes for molecular dynamics where the bath is treated classically, such as Ehrenfest dynamics, are shown to correctly capture short-time decoherence when the initial conditions are sampled from the Wigner distribution.

The algorithm has the structure of Ehrenfest equations plus a “coupled-trajectory” term for both the electronic and nuclear equations, and we analyze the relative roles played by the diﬀerent nonadiabatic terms in these equations, including how they are computed in practice. In particular, we show that while the coupled-trajectory term in the electronic equation is essential in yielding accurate dynamics, that in the nuclear equation has a much smaller eﬀect. A decoherence time is extracted from the electronic equations and compared with that of augmented fewest-switches surfacehopping.

The algorithm has the structure of Ehrenfest equations plus a “coupled-trajectory” term for both the electronic and nuclear equations, and we analyze the relative roles played by the diﬀerent nonadiabatic terms in these equations, including how they are computed in practice. In particular, we show that while the coupled-trajectory term in the electronic equation is essential in yielding accurate dynamics, that in the nuclear equation has a much smaller eﬀect. A decoherence time is extracted from the electronic equations and compared with that of augmented fewest-switches surfacehopping. We revisit a series of nonadiabatic Tully model systems to illustrate our analysis.},

Bohr's assertion that there are no causes in atomic scale systems is, as a closer analysis reveals, not in line with the Copenhagen interpretation since it would contain a statement about reality. What Bohr should have written is that there are no causes in mathematics, which is universally acknowledged. The law of causality requires physical effects to be due to physical causes. For this reason any theoretical model which replaces physical causes by mathematical objects is creationism, that is, it creates physical objects out of mathematical elements. I show that this is the case for most of quantum mechanics.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Direct numerical approaches for the solution of the time-independent one-dimensional Schrödinger equation are discussed. Applications to multiquantum well (MQW) semiconductor heterostructure potentials need linear dependence of the computer time tcomp on the number of spatial grid points N. Although acknowledged as a very effective Fourier grid Hamiltonian (FGH) method, it has cubic dependence on the number of spatial grid points, i.e., tcomp ∼ N 3 , which limits its use to problems with a complexity of N ≤ 1000. A simple straightforward shooting method (ShM), which is based on trial stepping over the coordinate and energy, has the necessary tcomp ∼ N dependence with moderate energy convergence efficiency but the recommended symmetry preconditions and the not very clearly defined external boundaries make its application inconvenient. This paper offers a new reliable and effective energy and wave function coupled solution (EWC) method with a Newton iteration scheme and an internal bordered tridiagonal matrix solver. The method has a linear distribution tasks with tcomp ∼ N dependence complexity up to N = and may by applied 105 and beyond. Zero to or arbitrary potential energy cyclic boundary conditions may be specified for the wave function. For versatile MQW tasks the combined use of ShM and EWC is illustrated. Detailed accuracy and computer time comparisons show that the combined ShM + EWC method is three orders of magnitude more effective than the FGH method.},

In this report, analytical relations underpinning the two methods are derived within the adiabatic basis to provide an implementation-level overview, with particular attention given to two avoidable sources of energy conservation deviation. It is not widely known that accuracy improvements can be obtained at negligible computational expense by allowing: (a) construction of the Schrödinger equation to account for analytic electronic phase propagation, and (b) inclusion of a Hellman–Feynman correctional term in the calculation of atomic forces. Particular emphasis on the algebraic formalism contrasts these inherent approximations, vis-à-vis the correctional approaches. The sensitivity of energy conservation with respect to phase propagation is exemplified by simulation of Xe molecular photodissociation on the repulsive Π(1/2) u excited surface. Simulations of a representative two-state avoided crossing system are presented to exemplify analytic quantities of the mean-field and surface-hopping approaches as well as to illustrate the inclusion of the Hellman–Feynman correctional term. Nonadiabatic propagation of the molecular wavefunction is observed by monitoring ground and excited state occupational probabilities, energy conservation, and nonadiabatic coupling as the system evolves along the model potential energy surfaces.},

Spencer et al., J. Chem. Phys. 145, 064102 (2016)]. In this method, the charge carrier wavefunction is expanded in a set of charge localized, diabatic electronic states and propagated in the time-dependent potential due to classical nuclear motion. Here we derive and implement an exact expression for the non-adiabatic coupling vectors between the adiabatic electronic states in terms of nuclear gradients of the diabatic electronic states. With the non-adiabatic coupling vectors (NACVs) available, we investigate how different flavours of fewest switches surface hopping affect detailed balance, internal consistency, and total energy conservation for electron hole transfer in a molecular dimer with two electronic states. We find that FOB-SH satisfies detailed balance across a wide range of diabatic electronic coupling strengths provided that the velocities are adjusted along the direction of the NACV to satisfy total energy conservation upon a surface hop. This criterion produces the right fraction of energy-forbidden (frustrated) hops, which is essential for correct population of excited states, especially when diabatic couplings are on the order of the thermal energy or larger, as in organic semiconductors and DNA. Furthermore, we find that FOB-SH is internally consistent, that is, the electronic surface population matches the average quantum amplitudes, but only in the limit of small diabatic couplings. For large diabatic couplings, inconsistencies are observed as the decrease in excited state population due to frustrated hops is not matched by a corresponding decrease in quantum amplitudes. The derivation provided here for the NACV should be generally applicable to any electronic structure approach where the electronic Hamiltonian is constructed in a diabatic electronic state basis.},

	abstract = {Description of correct electron−nuclear couplings is crucial in modeling of nonadiabatic dynamics. Within traditional semiclassical or mixed quantum−classical dynamics, the coupling between quantum electronic states and classical nuclear trajectories is governed by nonadiabatic coupling vectors coupled to classical nuclear momenta. This enables us to develop a very powerful nonadiabatic dynamics algorithm, namely, surface hopping dynamics, which can describe the splitting of nuclear wave packets and detailed balance. Despite its eﬃciency and practicality, it suﬀers from the lack of quantum decoherence due to incorrect accounts for the electron−nuclear coupling. Here we present a new surface hopping algorithm based on the exact electron−nuclear correlation from the exact factorization of molecular wave functions. This algorithm demands comparable computational costs to existing surface hopping methods. Numerical simulations with two-state models and a multidimensional multistate realistic molecule show that the electron−nuclear coupling beyond the nonadiabatic coupling terms can describe the quantum coherence properly.},

The method is based on the quasi-classical interpretation of the nuclear wave function, whose phase is related to the classical momentum and whose density is represented in terms of classical trajectories. In this approximation, electronic decoherence is naturally induced as effect of the coupling to the nuclei and correctly reproduces the expected quantum behaviour. Moreover, the splitting of the nuclear wave packet is captured as consequence of the correct approximation of the time-dependent potential of the theory. This new approach offers a clear improvement over Ehrenfest-like dynamics. The theoretical derivation presented in the Letter is supported by numerical results that are compared to quantum mechanical calculations.},

	abstract = {We present a new algorithm for mixed quantum-classical dynamics that helps bridge the gap between mean-field (Ehrenfest) and surface-hopping dynamics by defining a natural rate of decoherence. In order to derive this decoherence result, we have expanded the number of independent variables in the usual Ehrenfest routine so that mixed quantum-classical derivatives are now propagated in time alongside the usual Ehrenfest variables. Having done so, we compute a unique rate of decoherence using two independent approaches: (i) by comparing the equations of motion for the joint nuclear-electronic probability density in phase space according to Ehrenfest dynamics versus partial Wigner transform dynamics and (ii) by introducing a frozen Gaussian interpretation of Ehrenfest dynamics which allows nuclear wave packets to separate. The first consequence of this work is a means to rigorously check the accuracy of standard Ehrenfest dynamics. Second, this paper suggests a nonadiabatic dynamics algorithm, whereby the nuclei are propagated on the mean-field (Ehrenfest) potential energy surface and undergo stochastic decoherence events. Our work resembles the surface-hopping algorithm of Schwartz and co-workers [J. Chem. Phys. 123, 234106 (2005)]—only now without any adjustable parameters. For the case of two electronic states, we present numerical results on the so-called “Tully problems” and emphasize that future numerical benchmarking is still needed. Future work will also treat the problem of three or more electronic states.},
